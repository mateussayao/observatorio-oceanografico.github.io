Hi there 👋

I am an Oceanographer, from the time when the hero was (is) Jacques Cousteau. My graduation focused on Geological Oceanography (B.Sc.) and Biological Oceanography (M.Sc.), both obtained at the Federal University of Rio Grande, RS Brazil in the period 1988–1993 and 1994–1997, respectively.

I had the opportunity to delve deep into Polar Oceanography, with my ⚡ first Antarctic cruise in 1994 (and the second in 1995) aboard the polar icebreaker Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP94-5 and NPB95-5), where I learned about the diversity and beauty of the ice. I followed in the footsteps of my mentor at the time and immersed myself in another fantastic experience: my PhD in Polar Oceanography at the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven – Germany, between 1997 and 2002.

Back in *Terra Brasilis*, I began teaching at the State University of Santa Cruz (Eastern Bahia, Brazil) and later in Santos, SP (UNESP, the extinct UNIMONTE, UniSanta and Senac Santos), from 2003 to 2011. I earned my first post-doc at Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos (USP) between 2007–2008 in the area of Hydrometry/Hydrology and soon after fell in love with Paleoceanography during a post-doc at the Geochemistry Department, Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), between 2011–2015.

I am currently a professor at the School of Engineering, UFF, where I teach modeling and climate change to engineers, and physical oceanography to graduate students (see PPG-DOT).

I’m (always) learning Python — yes, it’s an infinite learning curve! Just when you think you've learned everything you need, a new package appears that changes everything. I'm deeply specialized in time series analysis of oceanographic and climatic data, with a focus on low-frequency signals, and also Machine Learning 🤖 and Deep Learning 🧠.

I’m currently working on a book about Time Series Analysis in Oceanography, and open to collaborations on paleoceanography and climate change tools. You can read some of my articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@andrebelem).

📫 How to reach me: pretty simple — my email is **andrebelem@id.uff.br**. You can also find me on LinkedIn, GitHub, ORCID, ResearchGate, or Lattes. If you'd like to talk in person, check out my current timetable at UFF.

Let's talk?

💬 Ask me about my hobbies: I'm vegetarian and love cooking, help manage a community garden and a small botanical collection, and enjoy stand-up paddling 🏄‍♂️, Polynesian canoeing, scuba diving, and outdoor photography.

⚡ Fun fact: in 2024 I celebrated **30 years of Antarctic fieldwork**. Yes, almost every year, I head to the frozen continent, do research, meet people and... feel at home.
